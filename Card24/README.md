It is recommended to create a new repository for any new project.

We utilized JDK15 when developing this project on Apache Netbeans, which is an IDE (integrated development environment) software. 

### Object of the game

Four cards will be randomly selected and provided on the screen. Using the cards provided, create a mathematical expression that equals 24.

### Gameplay

The values for each card are as follows: 
> - Aces are worth 1  
> - Number cards (2-10) are the same as their value shown  
> - Jacks are worth 11  
> - Queens are worth 12  
> - Kings are worth 13  
  
- All four card values should be used, but each number can only be used once in the expression.  
- Card values can be added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided.  
   -*Mathematical operators can be used more than once, but ***all operators do not need to be used***.*  
   -*Parenthesis can be used in your expression to signify order of precedence.*
